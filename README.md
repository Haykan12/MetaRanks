# MetaRanks
Machine learning methods are increasingly used in observational studies to identify predictive features. To synthesise results from analyses done across multiple cohorts, meta-analyses are usually applied. However, there are currently no methods to quantitatively synthesise results from multiple studies based on ML methods. Our aim was to describe a novel meta-analytical approach (MetaRanks) for assessing the association of environmental exposures with BMI across eight cohorts, as well as quantifying between-study heterogeneity and uncertainty. Meta-ranks offers a generic framework to effectively combine results obtained from different ML models applied to multiple cohorts.
